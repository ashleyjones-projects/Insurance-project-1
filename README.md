# Insurance-project-1

This is a quick project that I put together that investiagtes the relationship between total charges made to clients and other features such as
age, BMI, smoking habits, number of children, and region. I have explored the data using Python Pandas, using data visualiztion 
(matplotlib, seaborn, plylab) and have used sklearn and statsmodels to determine feature importance,as well as, using multi 
variate regression to predict overall charges The data was obtained from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance). 
Nothing overally fancy, just some good old fashioned data science to help try and gain insight from a bunch of numbers!

The results are there to try and direct, educate both client and insurance company in order to for a healthier life, but also to save some money for possibe future charges.
